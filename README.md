# javaHashMap
An extremely fast and efficient hashmap (dictionary) implementation for Java. Designed and based on Google's dense hashmap in C++. Utilized linear probing for cashe efficiency, a byte long bloom-filter for fast lookups, tombstone markers for fast deletes, and dynamic hash-collision avoidance.
